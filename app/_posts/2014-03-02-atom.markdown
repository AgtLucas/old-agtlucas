description: The GitHub new text editor!

In the last week, Atom, the new text-editor made by GitHub was announced.

>Atom is a desktop application based on web technologies. Like other desktop apps, it has its own icon in the dock, native menus and dialogs, and full access to the file system.

I had the beta access thanks to a friend, and I've been using Atom since the last 24 hours. Here are my first impressions:

* Very similar to Sublime
* A lot of plugins
* Package Control is cool!
* A little heavier than Sublime Text 3 (beta)
* Awesome configurations by default

Really liked the Atom so far, just crashed one time.

More information about Atom soon!
