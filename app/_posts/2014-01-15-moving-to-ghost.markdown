description: From Ruby to Node.js, moving to Ghost!
---

I'd been planning this for a while, I guess since the <a href="http://ghost.org" target="_blank">Ghost</a> launch and now I'm sure, I'll move this entire blog to Ghost Platform.

### Why?

Well, first of all, I love Jekyll <3 (I know some people that will make joke about this <3 but I don't care!), it's simple, easy to use, I could make a entire post with all the Jekyll's good things! Nothing to complain about it!

But why I'll switch to Ghost? I think the main reason for this is because Ghost is powered by Node.js, in other words, I wanna improve my Node skills!

I can't wait to get everything up and running on Ghost, and I'll document this whole adventure in this new and unexplored platform!
