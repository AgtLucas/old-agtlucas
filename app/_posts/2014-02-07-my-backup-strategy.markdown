description: Backup everything!

Nowadays, with the large amount of information we create, we must have a backup strategy. Is something primordial.

Currently, my backup strategy is:

>* 1TB account on Cloud Mail.ru (Just for funny images/gifs)
* Google Drive Account
* Dropbox
* 500GB external drive

Recently I've been testing <a href="http://www.backblaze.com/" target="_blake">Blackbaze</a> and I really enjoy this service. I'm not so sure if I'll upgrade my account after trial's end, but I highly recommend, test it for yourself!
