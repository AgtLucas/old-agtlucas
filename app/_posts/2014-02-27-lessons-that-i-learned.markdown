Review about this year so far:

### A post per day is hard!

It's very hard, but in the other hand, seems like my ideas and creativity are flowing better.

### Jekyll seems not to be ideal for the item above

At least, using the <a href="https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb" target="_blank">Yeoman Jekyll Generator.</a> I really love this generator, but there's some stuff that make me sad about it. e.g. the deploy process that "regenerate" all your pages. I'm still not sure, but I think sooner or later I'll really migrate to Ghost.

Anyway, this year has been a great year!
