description: 2014 - A brave new world!
---

So, a new year has began, and with that I decide to put my new site on air.

I did some changes to this new version, first of, focus on content, a very simple and clean design. Almost a distraction free design. Ok, I'm not a designer, but I think the result is satisfactory, I liked it.

Of course I have a bunch of stuff to improve, like social sharing, comment system, but for now...

Backing to the post's subject, 2013 was a great year, I learnt a lot, and besides of the bad things that happened, I wouldn't change anything, if I could.

For this year, I have some big plans and I hope that I can achieve all of them!

That's all folks!
