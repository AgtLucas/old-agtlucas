description: My year so far
---

It's almost april, and today I was thinking in how my year is going, so far. So, this is a little review of 1/4 of my year.

To get start, the lessons I've learned:

### Lessons learned

* Open dialog is the way to go
* The truth is hard, but is the better choice
* <a href="http://agtlucas.com/blog/2014/03/01/mission-failed.html">One blog post per day it's extremely hard!</a>
* You can't make the difference until you make the difference for yourself
* Don't fear the fail, fear the same

This 5 lessons has made my year so far.

For the next 2/4, I ~~wanna~~ will achieve:

* Migrate this site to Ghost (in progress, 70% done)
* Start my own business

That's it!
