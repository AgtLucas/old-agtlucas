We're living a revolution, right now! The name of this revolution is Node.js.

I'm not too young, and not too old to had witnessed the browsers war in 1990s, but I'm fortunate to watching the Node.js revolution.

In fact, this is something a little creepier, how Node.js has growing and evolving since their initial release in 2009. Day after day, more and more companies have been adopting Node as your main server side technology.

Back in 2013, <a href="https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2013/11/22/node-js-at-paypal/" target="_blank">PayPal had announced your migration from Java to Node.js</a>, creating your own framework, <a href="http://krakenjs.com/" target="_blank">Krakenjs</a>.

Yahoo announced that in <a href="http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/nodeweekly" target="_blank">the next 12 months, they will become the largest installation of Node.js in the world, and they are hiring!</a>.

And many, many other companies are using Node.js right now. This is so cool, one language to rule them all, on the server and client side!

2014 will be Node.js year, so, get ready and Happy Node!
