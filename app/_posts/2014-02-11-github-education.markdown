GitHub is really awesome, everyone know that, but, probably not everyone knows that GitHub offers Micro Plans (5 privates repos) for students.

I got my education plan since beginning of 2013 and finally, GitHub has done a step forward creating a website to explain in more detail how this program works

Go ahead and grab it <a href="https://education.github.com/" target="_blank">here</a>!

Thank you GitHub!
