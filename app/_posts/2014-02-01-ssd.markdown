description: Finally I switched from a HDD to a SSD!
---

Hello everybody!

No more disc spins, no more disc noise, I finally put a SSD on my MacBook Pro! And the result, as I expected, is far more than excellent.

The model that I've choose is a <a href="http://amzn.com/B00E3W15P0" target="_blank" target="_blank">Samsung 840 Evo 120GB</a>. This model use <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/MLC-vs-SLC-Which-flash-SSD-is-right-for-you" target="_blank">TLC</a> (Triple Level Cell) and is really, really faster!

After I get everything up and running, I disabled some things, such Hard Drive Sudden Motion Sensor (SSD has no moving parts):

{% highlight bash %}
sudo pmset -a sms 0
{% endhighlight %}

Also, I enabled the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim_(computing)" target="_blank">TRIM</a> with <a href="http://www.groths.org/software/trimenabler/" target="_blank">Trim Enabler app</a>, super easy.

Cya!
