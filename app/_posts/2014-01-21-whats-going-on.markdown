Hello everyone,

Since I've decided to migrate this entire site to Ghost, I doing some changes here, mostly in some performance gaps.

I removed jQuery and all other dependent scripts. I don't have anything against jQuery, I just remove it for performance sake!

Also, I removed all social scripts, no more comment system and shared stuffs, again, just for performance sake. Actually I'm trying to figure out how to improve these details.

At the Ghost migration fields, I'm still studying and planning how to make the migration without data lost, I meant, without lost all the posts that I have here.

That's it, time to go back to work!

Cya!
