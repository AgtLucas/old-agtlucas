Well, June's over yesterday and I didn't post anything since then.

### But Why?

May and June was two busy months, for real. I created the GDG Jaragu√° do Sul and we did two events, in a gap between 25 days. It was a total blast. <a href="http://agtlucas.com/blog/2014/05/22/farewell.html">I quit my job</a>, and I've started my own business: <a href="http://awlka.com" target="_blank">AWLKA</a>.

### What's next?

A lot of new things will come really soon, stay tuned!
