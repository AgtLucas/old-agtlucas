description: Open Source Git Management Software

Hello everybody, a long time since my last post, so let's keep things straightforward.

This week, I had the opportunity to play a little with GitLab.

So, what is GitLab? From the <a href="http://www.gitlab.com" target="_blank">GitLab site</a>:

> GitLab offers git repository management, code reviews, issue tracking, activity feeds and wikiâ€™s. Enterprises install GitLab on-premise and connect it with LDAP and Active Directory servers for secure authentication and authorization. A single GitLab server can handle more than 25,000 users but it is also possible to create a high availability setup with a multiple active servers.

In my case, I'm using GitLab Community Edition (CE):

> GitLab Community Edition (CE) is open source software to collaborate on code.
Create projects and repositories, manage access and do code reviews.
The Community Edition is installable software that you can use on-premise.

I installed GitLab on a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=c7f065a7eded" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> server. I'm using a server with 512Mb of memory and it's running blaze fast. Yep, the GitLab's documentation recommends at least 1Gb of memory, but just for me play around, 512Mb is sufficient.

GitLab is really cool, works almost like GitHub, even your look and feel is similar. Things like issues, pull requests, snippets (gist), branch compare are awesome.

Even more awesome is the Merge Request! Yep, you can request a branch merge.

If you'd like to install a git management tool, you definitely should give GitLab a shoot!
