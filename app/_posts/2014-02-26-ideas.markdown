description: Follow your dreams!
---

Today a friend of mine told me about some ideas, in fact, some old ideas, old projects that because of something, never went forward.

One of those ideas, was a prototype of one project and I think we'll finally make it happen!

If you have an idea or a dream, never give up of them! It will take while, will take some of your time, you probably will sleep less, but at the end of day, you'll say; “Mission Accomplished!”
