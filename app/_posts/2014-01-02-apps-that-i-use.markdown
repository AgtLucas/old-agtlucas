description: Apps that I use
---

Whichever is your development platform of choice, I'm sure you've a lot of apps that you cannot live without.

I'm of those people that enjoy to test and discover new apps, and because of that, I've decide to share the apps I use every day (or, almost every day).

<img src="/img/apps.png" alt="My Apps on Dock">

Following the image above, after Finder and App Store (the two first of the left):

**<a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword" target="_blank">1Password</a>**: Ok, 1Password this is a little bit expensive, but worth. The best way you can organize all of your 21315812312 of passwords.

**Calendar**: The OS X default calendar is good enough for me, I can easily sync it through my Google accounts.

**iBooks**: I own a lot of eBooks and before OS X Mavericks, It was a hell to keep all of my eBooks organized. Now I can, iBooks works like a charm, really awesome.

**<a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/en/" target="_blank">Wunderlist</a>**: Wunderlist, simple to-do list.

**<a href="http://evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a>**: Needs no comment!

**<a href="http://mouapp.com/" target="_blank">Mou</a>**: Really cool Markdown editor.

**<a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/" target="_blank">YNAB</a>**: Another app a little bit expensive, again, worth every cent paid. With this app, I can easily organize my budget, it's awesome.

**<a href="http://skype.com" target="_blank">Skype</a>**: Needs no comment!

**<a href="http://spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, <a href="http://rdio.com" target="_blank">Rdio</a>, <a href="http://apple.com/itunes" target="_blank">iTunes</a>**: I can't work without good music, then that explain why I've use this three apps. â™« Now Playing: The Aftermath - Iron Maiden!

**<a href="http://apple.com/safari" target="_blank">Safari</a>, <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Firefox Nightly</a>, <a href="http://firefox.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html" target="_blank">Canary</a>, <a href="https://download-chromium.appspot.com/" target="_blank">Chromium</a>**: Again, needs no comment!

**<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a>**: What can I say about this excelent code editor? Well, this is my favourite code/text editor since a long time, I guess since 2010, ok, isn't much time, but are 4 years. I still use the 2.0.2 version, and can't wait to get the 3.0 stable version!

**<a href="http://www.iterm2.com/" target="_blank">iTerm2</a>**: This is my terminal of choice, I love it, the flexibility, extensions, customizations, etc...

**<a href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets</a>**: With Brackets, I'm trying to killing my dependence of Sublime Text 2.

**<a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/" target="_blank">CodeKit</a>**: I've used to use this app often, before I know Grunt, but I'm still using in some projects.

**<a href="http://kapeli.com/dash" target="_blank">Dash</a>**: If you're a developer and Mac user, you should use this app, a lot of documentation available even offline. Pretty handy.

That's cover the dock image, but I use a lot of other apps and I'll cover them in other post.

For now, I think it's over.

That's all folks!
