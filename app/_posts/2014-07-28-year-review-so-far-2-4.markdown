description: My year so far, a little late...
---

I'm a little late with this post, but here we go, the second part of my year's review. <a href="http://agtlucas.com/blog/2014/03/29/year-review-so-far-1-4.html" target="_blank">First part.</a>


### Lessons learned
* "The only easy day was yesterday".
* Look to the past, sometimes is dangerous, sometimes is worthwhile.
* Risk yourself, find your limits.


### Mission Accomplished

* Start my own business

### Mission Failed

* Migrate this site to Ghost. This is a little odd, because I really planned this migration, but I give up.

Cya.
