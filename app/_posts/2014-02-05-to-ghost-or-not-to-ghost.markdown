I reached a point that is very hard to handle all my "everyday" posts here in Jekyll, so, change to another platform like Ghost, would be ideal. Sort of.

The problem is, I'm a web performance aficionado, and I'm afraid that I can't achieve the same speed on Ghost. Ok, I have to try in production to confirm that, but for now I'm concerned about this.

I'll continue my journey, and soon I'll post the final result here.

Cya!
