description: Apps that I use - Part 2
---

Hello everybody,

Yesterday, <a href="http://agtlucas.com/blog/2014/01/02/apps-that-i-use.html" target="_blank">I'd share some apps that I use</a> and today I'll cover other apps:

**<a href="http://alfredapp.com" target="_blank">Alfred + Powerpack</a>**: If you're a Mac user and don't have Alfred installed yet, stop reading this, go ahead and download it right now. Seriously, Alfred has the power to boost your productivity, and Alfred + Powerpack has the power to REALLY boost your productivity. Seriously.

**<a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> + <a href="http://google.com/drive" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>**: I've been using Dropbox for many years, really cool app, I can easily sync my files across my devices, and Google Drive too, the best feature about Google Drive (IMHO) it's the integration with all of other Google Products.

**<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html" target="_blank">Adobe CC</a>**: Despite the fact that it's a little overpriced (IMHO), I really like this new Adobe's service.

**<a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/pages/" target="_target">Apple Pages</a>**: Lighter and simple than the Microsoft Word, Pages is my word processor of choice.

**<a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html" target="_target">MAMP</a>**: I don't using this often like before, but when I have to use it, works very well.

Yep, I don't use any email client, so that's all.

Until the next time!
