description: Trying Gulp
---

In the last week of 2013, on my Twitter feed (or it was on Google Plus? Doesn't matter), I saw a link about something called Gulp. I opened up <a href="http://travismaynard.com/writing/no-need-to-grunt-take-a-gulp-of-fresh-air" target="_blank">that link</a>, scrolled the page like a ninja and didn't understand anything, of course, because I didn't read the article...

Gulp is a Javascript task runner/streaming build system created by <a href="http://wearefractal.com" target="_blank">Fractal</a>. Gulp uses the concept about <a href="https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook" target="_blank">Streams</a>.

So, Today I've started to play with <a href="http://gulpjs.com" target="_blank">Gulp</a> and I wanna share with you my first impressions.

> If you'd like to learn how to get start, I highly recomend the <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/README.md#gulp---" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="http://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp" target="_blank">this article</a>.

## What I liked:

**Simplicity**:
Gulp is code over configuration, you don't need to care much about how to configure your environment, in fact, you basically need to know 5 functions:

{% highlight javascript %}

// Return a readable stream
gulp.src(glob)

// Return a writable stream
gulp.dest(folder)

// Register a task
gulp.task(name, fn)

// Execute tasks
gulp.run(tasks)

// Watch file changes
gulp.watch(glob, fn)

{% endhighlight %}

Bellow an example of a real `gulpfile.js`:

{% highlight javascript %}

// Include gulp
var gulp = require('gulp');

// Plugins
var compass = require('gulp-compass');

// Tasks

// Compass
gulp.task('compass', function() {
  gulp.src('./assets/scss/*.scss')
      .pipe(compass({
        config_file: './config.rb'
      }))
      .pipe(gulp.dest('./assets/css'));
});

// Default Task
gulp.task('default', function() {
  gulp.run('compass');

  // Watch the files
  gulp.watch('./assets/scss/**/*.scss', function() {
    gulp.run('compass');
  });
});

{% endhighlight %}

Pretty simple, I really liked it.

## What I dislike

**Concurrency model**:
As far as I understood, every task runs in parallel, in other words, you can't have a task that execute other tasks in order. Maybe I'm wrong, at least I didn't figured out how can I do this.

## Final Words

To finish up, I think Gulp is a great tool, already have more than <a href="http://gratimax.github.io/search-gulp-plugins/" target="_blank">100 plugins</a> and this number will surely grows. For now, I'll still using <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> as my task runner of choice, but, I'll keep my eyes open on Gulp, because is very good to know that you have other choices!

That's all folks!
