description: One of the best talks I ever seen!
---

Last week, on days 14th and 15th, Uruguay received the <a href="http://jsconf.uy/" target="_blank">JS Conf Uruguay 2014</a>.

Today I was searching on YouTube some video about some talks, and I found one from JS Conf Uruguay **2013**:
Doesn't matter the year, this is one of the best talk about JS I've seen in my live!
